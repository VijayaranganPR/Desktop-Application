1) create one working directory
2) in terminal use 'npm init' to initialize the package.json file.
this is return:



This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

See `npm help init` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install <pkg>` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

Press ^C at any time to quit.

About to write to C:\Users\prvij\Desktop\Java Script\22electron.js\Hello World\package.json:

{
  "name": "hello-world",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "for understanding electron",
  "main": "main.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "electron ."
  },

}


Is this OK? (yes) yes

3) now the package.json file will be created, now install electron as DEVDEPENDENCY using 
'npm install electron --save-dev'

this will create a node_modules so that each one no need to be defined as devDependencies each time.

4) now create the main.js file in root dir and run the terminal as 'npm run test' to execute
