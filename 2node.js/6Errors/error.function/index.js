/*
The error.function property is not a standard property of the Error object in JavaScript or Node.js. 
It is a custom property that might be used in some libraries or applications to provide additional information about the source of an error.

The error.function property could provide the name of the function that caused the error. 
The exact meaning and usage of the error.function property would depend on the specific library or application in which it is used.
