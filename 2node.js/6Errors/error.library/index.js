/*
Like the error.function property, the error.library property is not a standard property of the Error object in JavaScript or Node.js. 
It is a custom property that might be used in some libraries or applications to provide additional information about the source of an error.

The error.library property could provide the name of the library that caused the error. 
The exact meaning and usage of the error.library property would depend on the specific library or application in which it is used.
