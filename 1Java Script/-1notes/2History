JavaScript is the scripting and programming language that powers the web.

History:
•	JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995. It was developed for Netscape 2 and became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997. After Netscape handed JavaScript over to ECMA, the Mozilla foundation continued to develop JavaScript for the Firefox browser. Mozilla's latest version was 1.8.
•	First the website sends the request to the data server where all the calculations take place and returns the data.
•	The team of Netscape need something different like updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. so they created a simple scripting language JS in 10 days by Brendan Eich in 1995.
